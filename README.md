# WDI Project Two

**Build a web-based, CRUD application.**

## Objectives

### Build confidence as a developer by building something of your own.

-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of
unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate
manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting.

## Tech Requirements

You will be expected to use the following technologies to implement this project:

- **HTML / EJS**: Your HTML should be semantic and valid. Your app uses EJS to render information on the page.
- **Node and Express**: Your app will need to have its own server, built using Express.
- **MVC Pattern**: Your app uses Models, Views, Controllers pattern we have gone over in class.
- **SQL / PG-PROMISE**: Your app will need to persist data. Your app should have **at least two related models**.
- Your app will need to make a third-party API call from the back-end using ANY npm package of your choosing.
    - [List of public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
    - [Another list of public APIs](https://github.com/abhishekbanthia/Public-APIs)
    - [Yet another list of public APIs](https://github.com/alexpanov/public-apis)
    - TRY OUT your API in postman before you get too emotionally invested in it, to make sure it works the way you think it does...
- **CSS & Design**: Your app should be pleasing to look at. Your design should take usability into account.

Here are a couple of example projects: [Forum](./helpers/forum.md), [Wiki](./helpers/wiki.md)

## Process

Resist the urge to jump immediately into coding.  For this sprint we want to carefully plan our approach.

- Database - draw out the tables & columns you plan to use in your database (ERD - Entity Relationship Diagram - is a fancy word for it)
- Wireframes - detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
  * You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes or use some program.
  * Refer back to the [todo app wireframes](./helpers/wireframes.md) for an example of what we expect!
- Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app
- Set up a separate standing github repo (NOT this repo!) and **project board** for your project
- Find an API that you plan on using and test it out

## Timeline

* *Start Planning* - 5:00PM on Thursday, December 21 - Choose a project and begin planning
* *Project Approvals* - 1:30PM-4PM on Friday, December 22 - Wireframes, user stories, database structure.
* *First Check-in* - 9AM Thursday, January 4 with squad leader - Project board, which API you plan to use, proof of concept.
* *Second Check-in* - 9AM on Friday, January 5 - Git repo, routes structure, database, initial Heroku deployment(we will provide the steps).
* *Stand Ups* - Every day with your squad leader
* *Presentations* - 10AM on Wednesday, January 11 

## Deliverables

- A full CRUD app, with create, edit, and delete functionality that has at least 2 related models and ulilizes a 3rd party API and is hosted on Heroku
- A public repository on **Github.com** with your code for this project & a thorough commit history dating back to the beginning of the project
- A thorough `README.md` file that contains the following:
    - The project's name and description
    - Your wireframes and user stories
    - The technologies, APIs, and modules you used and a description of each
    - A code snippet of a part of the app you're particularly proud of
    - Any things you plan to fix or features you plan to add
    - Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost
- A presentation in class that:
    - Is 5 minutes in length
    - Shows off the features of the app you're most proud of
    - Explains one or two technical details
    - Explains one or two technical challenges
    - Explains which improvements you might make


## Instructional help
Your squad leader will meet with you every day during the week of the project in 30-minute blocks for one-on-one help between 9 and noon.

## Keep in Mind

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can *seem* like roadblocks. Resist the urge to get frustrated. These are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish everything; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors often provide the most valuable source of information about what we don't yet understand. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing code until "it works" won't teach you anything. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

**Pro-Tip** - 'Failure is a temporary state.' :v:

### A Note on Plagiarism

Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for expulsion. Our entire policy can be found [HERE](./helpers/plagiarism-policy.md).

You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and stackoverflow, for help. However, it is NOT ACCEPTABLE TO COPY another person's code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
* Turning in work that is not your own.
* Turning in someone else's work as your own.
* Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
* Copying words or code without giving credit.
* Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
* Giving incorrect information about a source.
* Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
* Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
* Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.
* Submitting work that consist of more than 50% of work that is not your own, even if cited!
